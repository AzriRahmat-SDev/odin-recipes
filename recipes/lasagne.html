			A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. This lasagne verde made
			with spinach pasta cannot be beaten. <br />
			It's excellent if you want to impress some guests — or even yourself.<br />
			It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into
			it.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<h3>Pasta</h3>
			<li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
			<li>⅝ cup semolina flour</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<h3>Ragu</h3>
			<li>2 table spoons of butter</li>
			<li>1 carrot, diced</li>
			<li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
			<li>1 onion, diced</li>
			<li>2 slices bacon, diced</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water
				to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add
				spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. Squeeze
				spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to
				make a paste. Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth.
				Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a
				smooth dough. Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook
				and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is
				translucent. Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly
				and browned. Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with
				salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a
				medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from
				heat, let rest for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and
				simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with
				salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.
			</li>
